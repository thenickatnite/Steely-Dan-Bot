# Steely-Dan-Bot
Python scripts that will tweet out a random Steely Dan lyric each hour provided you have Twitter API access.
Makes heavy use of the "Tweety" Python library to handle the twitter API calls and requests. This repo has an example "lyrics.txt" file that contains only Steely Dan lyrics, however this could easily be edited to any other artist's lyrics provided the file within the repo is titled "lyrics.txt". This also contains a Dockerfile for easy Docker image and container creation as well as a "requirements.txt" for easy creation of virtual enviroments when running locally.
