Way back when, in '67
I was the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?
Hey Nineteen
No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
Hey Nineteen
That's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember the Queen of Soul
It's hard times befallen
The sole survivors
She thinks I'm crazy
But I'm just growing old
Hey Nineteen
No, we got nothing in common
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
Nice!
Sure looks good!
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Skate a little lower, now
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at allIn the mornin you go gunnin'
For the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in
But they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all sangin'
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hangin'
And they put you on the street
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again
When you know she's no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'
You'll be on your knees tomorrow
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again
Now you swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gambling man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table
Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it againThis is the day
Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues 
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues 
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it
Peg
I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie
I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie
Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movieYour everlasting summer
And you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something
That you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious
I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
You been tellin' me you're a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you
I still don't know what you mean
The weekend at the college
Didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?While the music played you worked by candlelight
Those San Francisco nights
You were the best in town
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl
You turned it on the world
That's when you turned the world around
Did you feel like Jesus?
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all
You'd go to L.A. on a dare
And you'd go it alone
Could you live forever?
Could you see the day?
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Now your patrons have all left you in the red
Your low rent friends are dead
This life can be very strange
All those Day-Glo freaks who used to paint the face
They've joined the human race
Some things will never change
Son, you were mistaken
You are obsolete
Look at all the white men on the street
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale
Just get it all out of here
Is there gas in the car
Yes, there's gas in the car
I think the people down the hall
Know who you are
Careful what you carry
'Cause the man is wise
You are still an outlaw in their eyes
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne, 
Get along, Kid CharlemagneIn the corner of my eye
I saw you in Rudy's
You were very high
You were high
It was a cryin' disgrace
They saw your face
On the counter by your keys
Was a book of numbers
And your remedies
One of these
Surely will screen out the sorrow
But where are you tomorrow
I can't cry anymore
While you run around
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
Down to Greene Street
There you go
Lookin' so outrageous
And they tell you so
You should know
How all the pros play the game?
Then you change your name
Like a gangster on the run
You will stagger homeward
To your precious one
I'm the one
Who must make everything right
Talk it out till daylight
I don't care anymore
Why you run around
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
I can't cry anymore
While you run around
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here
So outrageous
So outrageous
So outrageousTimes are hard
You're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
'Cause your man is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work no moreDrive west on Sunset to the sea
Turn that jungle music down
Just until we're out of town
This is no one night stand
It's a real occasion
Close your eyes and you'll be there
It's everything they say
The end of a perfect day
Distant lights from across the bay
Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me I'm the only one
Here come those Santa Ana winds again
We'll jog with show folk on the sand
Drink kirschwasser from a shell
San Francisco show and tell
Well I should know by now
That it's just a spasm
Like a Sunday in T.J
That it's cheap but it's not free
That I'm not what I used to be
And that love's not a game for three
Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me I'm the only one
Here come those Santa Ana winds again
My friends say no don't go
For that cotton candy
Son you're playing with fire
The kid will live and learn
As he watches his bridges burn
From the point of no return
Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me I'm the only one
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake itWe're gonna break out the hats and hooters
When Josie comes home
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters
When Josie comes home to stay
We're gonna park in the street
Sleep on the beach and make it
Throw down the jam till the girls say when
Lay down the law and break it
When Josie comes home
When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
Jo would you love to scrapple
She'll never say no, no!
Shine up the battle apple
We'll shake 'em all down tonight
We're gonna mix in the street
Strike at the stroke of midnight
Dance on the bones till the girls say when
Pick up what's left by daylight
When Josie comes home
When Josie comes home
So bad
She's the best friend we never had
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire
When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fireI remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes
When you put me on the Wolverine
Up to Annandale
It was still September
When your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls
In the county jail
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair
I said oh no
William and Mary won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school
Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
Up in Annandale
I can't stand her
Doing what she did before
Leaving like a gypsy queen
In a fairy tale
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said whoa no
Guadalajara won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school
California tumbles into the sea
That'll be the day I go
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
About Chino and Daddy Gee
But I can't seem to get to you
Through the U.S. Mail
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said oh no
Guadalajara won't do, now
Well I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old schoolSon you better be ready for love
On this glory day
This is your chance to believe
What I've got to say
Keep your eyes on the sky
Put a dollar in the kitty
Don't the moon look pretty
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
I am holding the mystical sphere
It's direct from Lhasa
Where people are rolling in the snow
Far from the world we know
Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mindYou go to Las Wages

All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'

While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
After closing time
At the Guernsey fair
I detect the El Supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs
Well I've been around the world
And I've been in the Washington zoo
And in all my travels
As the facts unravel
I've found this to be true
While the poor people sleepin'

While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night
They got the house on the corner
With the rug inside
They got the booze they need
All that money can buy
They got the shapely bodies
They got the Steely Dan T-shirt
And for the Coup de grâce
They're outrageous
Oh, honey let me tell you
While the poor people sleepin'

I thought our little wild time had just begun
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
But if you have a change of heart
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
I have a friend in town, he's heard your name
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row
We could stay inside and play games, I don't know
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
Rikki, don't lose that number
Rikki, don't lose that numberKaty tried, I was halfway crucified
I was on the other side
Of no tomorrow
You walked in, and my life began again
Just when I'd spent the last
Piaster I could borrow
All night long
We would sing that stupid song
And every word we sang
I knew was true
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
Are you crazy, are you high
Or just an ordinary guy
Have you done all you can do
Are you with me Doctor
Don't seem right
I've been strung out here all night
I've been waiting for the taste
You said you'd bring to me
Biscayne Bay, where the Cuban
Gentlemen sleep all day
I went searching for the song
You used to sing to me
Katy lies, you can see it in her eyes
But imagine my surprise
When I saw you
Are you with me Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
She is lovely yes she's sly
And you're an ordinary guy
Has she finally got to you
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor
Are you with me Doctor
Can you hear me Doctor6:05, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good
He's a crowd pleasing man
One on one
He's schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard
He's Jungle Jim, again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car
We're a star
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel
With his Eurasian bride
On the town
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers
Is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness
While they danced
I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
That's my claim to fame
Jive Miguel
He's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight
At Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done
I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boysJust when I say
"Boy we can't miss
You are golden"
Then you do this
You say this guy is so cool
Snapping his fingers like a fool
One more expensive kiss-off
Who do you think I am
Lord I know you're a special friend
But you don't seem to understand
We got heavy rollers
I think you should know
Try again tomorrow
Can't you see they're laughing at me
Get rid of him
I don't care what you do at home
Would you care to explain
Who is the gaucho amigo
Why is he standing
In your spangled leather poncho
And your elevator shoes
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend
Will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome
What I tell you
Back down the line
I'll scratch your back
You can scratch mine
No he can't sleep on the floor
What do you think I'm yelling for
I'll drop him near the freeway
Doesn't he have a home
Lord I know you're a special friend
But you refuse to understand
You're a nasty schoolboy
With no place to go
Try again tomorrow
Don't tell me he'll wait in the car
Look at you
Holding hands with the man from Rio
Would you care to explain
Who is the gaucho amigo
Why is he standing
In your spangled leather poncho
With the studs that match your eyes
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend
Will never be welcome here
High in the CusterdomeWhen Black Friday comes
I'll stand down by the door
And catch the grey men when they
Dive from the fourteenth floor
When Black Friday comes
I'll collect everything I'm owed
And before my friends find out
I'll be on the road
When Black Friday falls
You know it's got to be
Don't let it fall on me
When Black Friday comes
I'll fly down to Muswellbrook
Gonna strike all the big red words
From my little black book
Gonna do just what I please
Gonna wear no socks and shoes
With nothing to do but feed
All the kangaroos
When Black Friday comes
I'll be on that hill
You know I will
When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna dig myself a hole
Gonna lay down in it
'til I satisfy my soul
Gonna let the world pass by me
The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me
And if he don't come across
I'm gonna let it roll
When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna stake my claim
I'll guess I'll change my nameWorry the bottle, Mama, it's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high-heel sneakers, it's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as they play till dawn
Nothin' but blues and Elvis
And somebody else's favorite song
Give her some funked-up Muzak, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static, no static at all
FM, no static at all
Give her some funked-up Muzak, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static, no static at all

Bodhisattva, would you take me by the hand
Can you show me the shine of your Japan
The sparkle of your China, can you show me
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
I'm gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva
I'm gonna sell my house in town
And I'll be there to shine in your Japan
To sparkle in your China, yes, I'll be there

Look out!Up on the hill, people never stare
They just don't care
Chinese music under banyan trees
Here at the dude ranch above the sea
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
Up on the hill, they've got time to burn
There's no return
Double helix in the sky tonight
Throw out the hardware, let's do it right
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
Up on the hill, they think I'm okay
Or so they say
Chinese music always sets me free
Angular banjoes sound good to me
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to youA world become one of salads and sun
Only a fool would say that
A boy with a plan, a natural man
Wearing a white Stetson hat
Unhand that gun begone
There's no one to fire upon
If he's holding it high
He's telling a lie
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
The man in the street dragging his feet
Don't wanna hear the bad news
Imagine your face there at his place
Standing inside his brown shoes
You do his nine to five
Drag yourself home half alive
And there on the screen
A man with a dream
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
Anybody on the street
Has murder in his eyes
You feel no pain
And you're younger than you realize
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool
I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say thatI recall when I was small
How I spent my days alone
The busy world was not for me
So I went and found my own
I would climb the garden wall
With a candle in my hand
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand
On the stone an ancient hand
In a faded yellow-green
Made alive a worldly wonder
Often told but never seen
Now and ever bound to labor
On the sea and in the sky
Every man and beast appeared
A friend as real as I
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasn't even any Hollywood
They heard the call
And they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood
Can it be this sad design
Could be the very same
A wooly man without a face
And a beast without a name
Nothin' here but history
Can you see what has been done?
Memory rush over me
Now I step into the sun
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasn't even any Hollywood
They heard the call
And they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasn't even any Hollywood
They heard the call
And they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understoodI never seen you looking so bad, my funky one
You tell me that your super fine mind has come undone
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell youWell I've kicked around a lot since high school
I've worked a lot of nowhere gigs
From keyboard man in a rock'n'ska band
To haulin' boss crude in the big rigs
Now I've come back home to plan my next move
From the comfort of my Aunt Faye's couch
When I see my little cousin Janine walk in
All I could say was ow-ow-ouch
Honey how you've grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
She turned my life into a living hell
In those little tops and tight capris
I pretended to be readin' the National Probe
As I was watchin' her wax her skis
On Saturday night she walked in with her date
And backs him up against the wall
I tumbled off the couch and heard myself sing
In a voice I never knew I had before
Honey how you've grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
I'll teach you everything I know
If you teach me how to do that dance
Life is short and quid pro quo
And what's so strange about a down-home family romance?
One night we're playin' gin by a cracklin' fire
And I decided to make my play
I said, "babe with my boyish charm and good looks
How can you stand it for one more day?"
She said, "maybe its the skeevy look in your eyes
Or that your mind has turned to applesauce
The dreary architecture of your soul"
I said: "but what is it exactly turns you off"?
Honey how you've grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
Songwriters:  Donald Fagen and Walter BeckerBabs and Clean Willie were in love they said
So in love the preacher's face turned red
Soon everybody knew the thing was dead
He shouts, she bites, they wrangle through the night, yeah
She go crazy
Got to make a getaway, Papa say
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce
She takes the taxi to the good hotel
Bon marché as far as she can tell
She drinks the zombie from the cocoa shell
She feels alright, she get it on tonight, yeah
Mister driver
Take me where the music play, Papa say
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce
At the Grotto
In the greasy chair
Sits the Charlie with the lotion and the kinky hair
When she smiled, she said it all
The band was hot so
They danced the famous Merengue
Now we dolly back
Now we fade to black
Tearful reunion in the U.S.A
Day by day those memories fade away
Some babies grow in a peculiar way
It changed, it grew, and everybody knew, yeah
Semi-mojo
Who's this kinky so-and-so? Papa go
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorceI know this super highway
This bright familiar sun
I guess that I'm the lucky one
Who wrote that tired sea song
Set on this peaceful shore
You think you've heard this one before
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last
She serves the smooth retsina
She keeps me safe and warm
It's just the calm before the storm
Call in my reservation
So long hey thanks my friend
I guess I'll try my luck again
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at lastNow they lay his body down
Sad old men who run this town
I still recall the way
He led the charge and saved the day
Blue blood and rain
I can hear the bugle playin'
We seen the last of good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on, and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to good King John, oh
While he plundered far and wide
All his starving children cried
And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line
We seen the last of good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on, and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to good King John
And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line
We seen the last of good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on, and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to good King John
Raise up your glass to good King John
Raise up your glass to good King JohnFive names that I can hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here
I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard
Yes I'm going insane
And I'm laughing in the frozen rain
Well I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
You fellah, you tearin' up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat?
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think that I don't see
That ditch out in the valley
That they're digging just for me?
Yes I'm going insane
You know I'm laughing at the frozen rain
Well I feel like I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
You know, going insane
Yes I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?
Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spendI decline to walk the line
They tell me that I'm lazy
Worldly wise, I realize
That everybody's crazy
A woman's voice reminds me
To serve and not to speak
Am I myself or just another freak?
You know there's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd love to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn, no no
With a cough, I shake it off
And work around my yellow stripe
Should I hide or eat my pride?
Or wait until it's good and ripe?
My life is boiling over
It's happened once before
I wish someone would open up the door
Don't you know there's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd love to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn
Don't you know
There's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd love to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn
Yeah
By, by, by, by, byThelonious, my old friend
Step on in and let me shake your hand
So glad that you're here again
For one more time
Let your madness run with mine
Streets still unseen, we'll find somehow
No time is better than now
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
The world that we used to know
People tell me it don't turn no more
The places we used to go
Familiar faces that ain't smiling like before
The time of our time has come and gone
I fear we've been waiting too long
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
Tell me where are you driving
Midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?

Is a bunker filled with sand
He's become a third world man
Smoky Sunday
He's been mobilized since dawn
Now he's crouching on the lawn
He's a third world man
Soon you'll throw down your disguise
We'll see behind those bright eyes
By and by
When the sidewalks are safe
For the little guy
I saw the fireworks
I believed that I was dreaming
Till the neighbors came out screaming
He's a third world man
Soon you'll throw down your disguise
We'll see behind those bright eyes
By and by
When the sidewalks are safe
For the little guy
When he's crying out
I just sing that Ghana Rondo
E l'era del terzo mondo
He's a third world man
He's a third world man
He's a third world manAnd they wandered in from the city
Of St. John without a dime
Wearing coats that shined both red and green
Colors from their sunny island
From their boats of iron they looked upon
The promised land where surely life was sweet
On the rising tide to New York City
Did they ride into the street
See the glory 
Of the royal scam
They are hounded down to the bottom
Of a bad town amid the ruins
Where they learn to fear an angry race
Of fallen kings, their dark companions
While the memory of their southern sky
Was clouded by the savage winter
Every patron saint hung on the wall
Shared the room with twenty sinners
See the glory 
Of the royal scam
By the blackened wall he does it all
He thinks he's died and gone to heaven
Now the tale is told by the old man
Back home he reads the letter
How they are paid in gold just to babble
In the back room all night and waste their time
And they wandered in from the city
Of St. John without a dime
See the glory 
Of the royal scam
See the glory 
Of the royal scam
See the glory 
Of the royal scamI would love to tour the Southland
In a travelling minstrel show
Yes, I'd love to tour the Southland
In a traveling minstrel show
Yes, I'm dying to be a star and make them laugh
Sound just like a record on the phonograph
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Hey, hey!
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time, yes I do
Cause he looks so fine upon that hill
They tell me he was lonely, he's lonely still
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
I stepped up on the platform
The man gave me the news
He said, You must be joking son
Where did you get those shoes?
Where did you get those shoes?
Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show
They say the times are changing but I just don't know
These things are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Oh yeah, hey, hey!Kids if you want some fun
Mr. LaPage is your man
He's always laughing, having fun
Showing his films in the den
Come on, come on
Soon you will be eighteen
I think you know what I mean
Don't tell your mama
Your daddy or mama
They'll never know where you been
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Listen to what I say
He wants to show you the way
Right down the hallway with open arms
To teach you a new game to play
Come on, come on
Soon it will be too late
Bobbing for apples can wait
I know you're used to sixteen or more
Sorry we only have eight
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Oh, babies come on
 come on
Kids if you want some fun
See what you never have seen
Take off your cheaters
And sit right down
Start the projection machine
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at lastHello one and all
Was it you I used to know?
Can't you hear me call
On this old ham radio
All I got to say
I'm alive and feeling fine
Should you come my way
You can share my poison wine
No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world as far as I know
I won't take your bread
I don't need no helping hand
I can't be no savage
I can't be no highwayman
Show me where you are
You and I will spend this day
Drivin' in my car
Through the ruins of Santa Fe
No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world as far as I know
I'm reading last year's papers
Although I don't know why
Assassins, cons and rapers
Might as well die
When you come around
No more pain and no regrets
Watch the sun go brown
Smoking cobalt cigarettes
There's no need to hide
Taking things the easy way
If I stay inside
I might live till Saturday
No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
King of the world, as far as I knowI don't mind the quiet
Or the lonely nights
I don't miss the funky attitudes
And I don't miss the fights
I lie on the couch 'til suppertime
And hunker down and read the Post
And that's when I remember the things I miss the most:
The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The Audi TT
The house on the Vineyard
The house on the Gulf Coast
These are the things I miss the most
I kinda like frying up
My sad cuisine
Getting in bed and curling up with a girlie magazine
Sometimes in the corner of my eye
I see that adorable ghost
And then ba-boom I remember the things I miss the most
The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The comfy Eames chair
The good copper pans
The '54 Strat
These are the things I miss the most
I had a little birdy friend
By morning she was gone
Birdie good-bye
Birdie bye bye
I'm learning how to meditate
So far so good
I'm building the Andrea Doria out of balsa wood
The days really don't last forever
But it's getting pretty damn close
And that's when I remember the things I miss the most
The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The Audi TT
The house on the Vineyard
The house on the Gulf Coast
These are the things I miss the mostThe wind was driving in my face
The Smell of Prickly Pear
The milk truck eased into my space
Somebody screamed somewhere
I struck a match against the door
Of Anthony's Bar and Grill
I was the whining stranger
A fool in love
With time to kill
I've got detectives on his case
They filmed the whole charade
He's got a scar across his face
He wears a hearing aid
Sure, he's a Jolly roger
Until he answers for his crimes
Yes, I'll match him whim for whim now
I still recall when I first held
Your tiny hand in mine
I loved you more than I can tell
But now it's stomping time
Sure he's a Jolly roger
Until he answers for his crimes
Yes, I'll match him whim for whim nowYou, in your Lark
You're a mark
You're a screamer
You know how to hustle
Daddy is a rare millionaire
I don't care
Yeah, you got the muscle
I got the news
Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow
Take it in your hand
All the sirens and the band
Get to bendin' my ear
How was I to know
About the warm
Soulful secret
You been keepin' for years
I got the news
Slow down I'll tell you when
I may never walk again
Broadway Duchess
Darling if you only knew
Half as much as
Everybody thinks you do
What I hear may be true
I would still be proud
To know you
Spanish kissin'
See it glisten
You came ragin'
Love rampagin'
I got the news
Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will growGot a feeling I've been here before
Watching as you cross the killing floor
You know you'll have to pay it all
You'll pay today or pay tomorrow
You fasten up your beaded gown
Then you try to tie me down
Do you work it out in one by one
Or played in combination
You throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
I have seen your iron and your brass
Can't you see it shine behind the glass
Your fortune is your roving eye
Your mouth and legs, your gift for the runaround
Torture is the main attraction
I don't need that kind of action
You don't have to dance for me
I've seen your dance before
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll
Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the year of the locust you'll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
There's one roulade she can't sing
Dumb luck my friend
Won't suck me in this time
Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the year of the locust you'll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
There's one roulade she can't sing
Dumb luck my friend
Won't suck me in this time
Got a feeling I've been here before
Won't you let me help you find the door
All you got to do is use
Your silver shoes, a gift for the runaround
Use your knack darlin'
Take one step back darlin'
There ain't nothing in Chicago
For a monkey woman to do
Uh-huh
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they rollWith stocking face I bought a gun
The plan was set, the plan was done
Looked at my watch and started for the door
Now the food here ain't so good no more
And they closed the package store
Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
My poison's named, you know my brand
So please make mine a double, Sam
Stir it up nice, I'll eat it right here
Yeah, this highway runs from Paraguay
And I've just come all the way
Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
We warned the corpse of William Wright
Not to cuss and drink all night
Ticket in hand, we saw him laid to rest
Woah, but zombie see and zombie do
He's here with me and you
Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
Turn that heartbeat over againWho are these children
Who scheme and run wild?
Who speak with their wings
And the way that they smile?
What are the secrets
They trace in the sky?
And why do you tremble
Each time they ride by?
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
Who are these strangers
Who pass through the door?
Who cover your action
And go you one more?
If you're feeling lucky
You best not refuse
It's your game the rules
Are your own win or lose
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unreal
Throw out your gold teeth
And see how they roll
The answer they reveal, life is unrealHave you heard about the boom on Mizar 5?
People got to shout to stay alive
They don't even have policeman a-one
Doesn't matter where you been or what you've done
Do you have a dark spot on your past
Leave it to my man he'll fix it fast
Pepe has a scar from ear to ear
He will make your mug shots disappear
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won't you sign in stranger
Do you like to take a yo-yo for a ride
Zombie I can see you're qualified
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues
They will call you sir and shine your shoes
Or maybe you would like to see the show
You'll enjoy the cafe d'escargot
Folks are in a line around the block
Just to see her do the can-can-jacques
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won't you sign in stranger
Love or leave her, yellow fever
Sure, it's all in the game
And who are you
Just another scurvy brother
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won't you sign in strangerIn the beginning
We could hang with the dude
But it's been too much of nothing
Of that stank attitude
Now they curse your name
And there's a bounty on your face
It's your own fault daddy
Godwhacker's on the case
We track your almighty ass thru seven heaven worlds
Me, Slinky Redfoot
And our trusty angel-girls
And when the stars bleed out
That be the fever of the chase
You better get gone poppie
Godwhacker's on the case
Be very very quiet
Clock everything you see
Little things might matter later
At the start of the end of history
Climb up the glacier
Across bridges of light
We sniff you, Big Tiger
In the forest of the night
'Cause there's no escape
From the Rajahs of Erase
Better run run run
Godwhacker's on the case
Be very, very quiet
Clock everything you see
Little things might matter later
At the start of the end of history
Yes we are the Godwhackers
Who rip and chop and slice
For crimes beyond imagining
It's time to pay the price
You better step back son
Give the man some whacking space
You know this might get messy
Godwhacker's on the caseA race of angels bound with one another
A dish of dollars laid out for all to see
A tower room at Eden Rock
His golf at noon for free
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
His lady's aching to bring a body down
She daily preaches on where she wants to be
An evening with a movie queen
A face we all have seen
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
A case of aces done up loose for dealing
A piece of island cooling in the sea
The whole of time we gain or lose
And power enough to choose
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Yeah, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under meOne plush summer you come to me ripe and ready
And bad through and through
With that deep mystical soul synergy pumping steady
Between me and you
Lovin' all the beautiful work we've done, cara mia
And it's barely July
If we keep on boppin' until Labor Day
Li'l miz Abbie - bye bye
What will it be - some soothing herb tea?
That might be just the thing
Let's say we spike it with Dilaudid
Or else - maybe tonight a hand of solitaire
Flame is the game
The game we call gaslighting Abbie
It's a luscious invention for three
One summer by the sea
With the long weekend that's comin' up fast
Let's get busy
There's just too much to do
That black mini looks just like the one she's been missin'
Feels good on you
There's a few items we need in town - allez-vous girl
There's no time to waste
Such as fresh cable and fifteen watt bulbs
Couple dozen - it's a big old place
Let's keep it light - we'll do a fright night
With blood and everything
Some punky laughter from the kitchen
And then - a nice relaxing hand of solitaire
Flame is the game
The game we call gaslighting Abbie
It's a luscious invention for three
One summer by the sea
You can choose the music
I'll set up my gear
Later on we'll chill and watch the fireworks from here
How can you knock this mighty spitelock
Check out the work itself
A mix of elegance and function
That's right - a tweak or two and then she's out of here
Flame is the game
The game we call gaslighting Abbie
It's a luscious invention for three
One summer by the seaAny news was good news
And the feelin' was bad at home
I was out of my mind and you were on the phone
Lonnie was the kingpin
Back in nineteen sixty-five
I was singing this song when Lonnie came alive
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
You were Lady Bayside
There was nothing that I could do
So I pointed my car down seventh avenue
Lonnie swept the playroom
And he swallowed up all he found
It was forty-eight hours till Lonnie came around
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston rag
Tell all your buddies that it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston ragTeddy's rolling now most every night
Skatin' backwards at the speed of light
He's changed - in a thousand little ways
He's changed - yes indeed
You know he's movin' on metal, yes he's
Hanging tight with the Jack of Speed
Sheena's party - there's a case in point
That right-wing hooey sure stunk up the joint
He's gone - he walks through the old routines
But he's gone - guaranteed
He may be sittin' in the kitchen, but he's
Steppin' out with the Jack of Speed
You maybe got lucky for a few good years
But there's no way back from there to here
He's a one way rider
On the shriek express
And his new best friend is at the throttle more or less
He can't hear you honey - that's alright
Pack some things and head up into the light
Don't stop - he'll be callin' out your name
But don't stop when you hear him plead
You better move now little darlin' or you'll be
Trading fours with the Jack of SpeedAgents of the law
Luckless pedestrian
I know you're out there
With rage in your eyes and your megaphones
Saying all is forgiven
Mad dog surrender
How can I answer
A man of my mind can do anything
I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Can you hear the evil crowd
The lies and the laughter
I hear my inside
The mechanized hum of another world
Where no sun is shining
No red light flashing
Here in this darkness
I know what I've done
I know all at once who I am
I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Don't take me aliveI'm not one to look behind, I know that times must change
But over there in Barrytown, they do things very strange
And though you're not my enemy
I like things like they used to be
And though you'd like some company
I'm standing by myself
Go play with someone else
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
Don't believe I'm taken in by stories I have heard
I just read the Daily News and swear by every word
And don't think that I'm out of line
For speaking out for what is mine
I'd like to see you do just fine
But look at what you wear
And the way you cut your hair
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
In the beginning we recall that the word was hurled
Barrytown people got to be from another world
Leave me or I'll be just like the others you will meet
They won't act as kindly if they see you on the street
And don't you scream or make a shout
It's nothing you can do about
It was there when you came out
It's a special lack of grace
I can see it in your face
I can see by what you carry that you come from BarrytownSteely Dan

It's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high heeled sneakers
It's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as they play till dawn
Nothing but blues and Elvis
And somebody else's favorite song
Give us some funked-up music
She treats you nice
Feed us some hungry reggae
She loves you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight

Give us some funked-up music
She treats you nice
Feed us some hungry reggae
She loves you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all, no static at all
FM--no static at all

Ware of the bottle, Mamma, it's grape fruit wine
Kick off your high heel sneakers, it's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as it plays till dawn
Nothin' but blues and Elvis
And somebody else's fav'rite song
Give her some funked up music she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all

Feed her some hungry reggae she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static at all
FM, no static at allI'm working on gospel time these days
The sloe-eyed creature in the reckless room she's so severe
A wise child walks right out of here
I'm so excited I can barely cope
I'm sizzling like an isotope
I'm on fire so cut me some slack
First she's way gone then she comes back
She's all business then she's ready to play
She's almost gothic in a natural way
This house of desire is built foursquare
When she speaks it's like the slickest song I ever heard
I'm hanging on her every word
As if I'm not already blazed enough
She hits me with the cryptic stuff
That's her style - to jerk me around
First she's all feel then she cools down
She's pure science with a splash of black cat
She's almost gothic and I like it like that
This dark place so thrilling and new
It's kind of like the opposite of an aerial view
Unless I'm totally wrong
I hear her rap and brother it's strong
I'm pretty sure that what she's telling me is mostly lies
But I just stand there hypnotized
I'll just have to make it work somehow
I'm in the amen corner now
It's called love - I spell L U V
First she's all buzz then she's noise-free
She's bubbling over then there's nothing to say
She's almost gothic in a natural way
She's old school then she's like young
Little eva meets the bleecker street brat
She's almost gothic but it's better than thatI hear you are singing a song of the past
I see no tears
I know that you know it may be the last
For many years
You'd gamble or give anything
To be in with the better half
But how many friends must I have
To begin with to make you laugh
Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day?
You know that the coming is so close at hand
You feel alright
I guess only women in cages can stand
This kind of night
I guess only women in cages
Can play down the things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down you can't refuse
Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day?
I guess only women in cages
Can play down the things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down you can't refuse
Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day?Bad news breaking in 18A
Missy's kitty turn inside out she say
Spider queen demon and that whole crew
Across the lobby the wicker wing chair flew
All the nice people those goodly souls
Quaking in their respective hidey-holes
Everyone's wasted in this gruesome dream
Not a one of them left to hear you scream
Two against nature don't you know
Who's gonna grok the shape of things to go
Two against nature make them groan
Who's gonna break the shape of things unknown
Madame Erzulie she come last night
Bang you silly but leave a nasty bite
There on your nightstand much worse than that
Panatela and old black derby hat
Call your doctor - call your shrink
Western science she strictly rinkydink
They all masissi but we hang tough
Absotively gonna help you beat that stuff
Two against nature tan and lean
Puttin' big heat on skanky things unseen
Two against nature slinging dread
These boys wanna bang the skulls of things undead
T-Bone Angie she champion liar
Sew the mouth shut with rusty chicken wire
Brother Lou Garue and the Jerry Garry
Sprinkling chicken water gonna hush all three
Beautiful housewife in deep distress
'Specially you deserve our very best
Two against nature they got that stuff
Good things happening when you see about us
Two against nature love this gig
Pull up the weeds before they're too damn big
Two against nature stand alone
Who's gonna chase the shape of things unknown
Two against nature don't you know
Who's gonna drop the boom on things to go
Two against nature make them groan
Gonna go bang-zoom to the moon on things unknown
Scrape the wallboards the whole damn batch
Catch the maggoty eggs before they hatch
Pepper and ratbone make damn sure
Shake the rubbish out on the patio floor
Soak the timber with special spray
Nuke the itty bitty ones right where they lay
Whip the bastards while they still green
Take the firemop - sweep it kissing cleanIt's a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain
But don't tell it to a poor man
Cause he's got to kill for every thrill
The best he can
Everywhere around me
I see jealousy and mayhem
Because no men have all their peace of mind
To carry them
Well I don't really care
If it's wrong or if it's right
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night
When the joker tried to tell me
I could cut it in this rube town
When he tried to hang that sign on me
I said "Take it down"
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice
They're gonna do it with a shotgun
Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life
For another one
Well I ain't got the heart
To lose another fight
So until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night
Well I don't really care
If it's wrong or if it's right
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night
Night by night
Night by night
Night by night
Night by nightSome turn out, a hundred grand
Get with it, we'll shake his hand
Don't bother to understand
Don't question the little man
Be part of the brotherhood
Yes it's, chain lightning
It feels so good
Hush brother, we cross the square
Act natural like you don't care
Turn slowly and comb your hair
Don't trouble the midnight air
We're standing just where he stood
It was chain lightning
It feels so goodI was grinding through my day gig
Stackin' cutouts at the Strand
When in walks Franny from NYU
We were quite an item back then
We talked about her films and shows and CDs
And I don't know what else
She said, yeah, Hollywood's been good to me
But tell me - how about yourself
I'm still working on that novel
But I'm just about to quit
Cause I'm worrying about the future now
Or maybe this is it
It's not all that I thought it would be
What a shame about me
She said, talk to me, do you ever see
Anybody else from our old crew
Bobby Dakine won the Bunsen Prize
Now he's coming out with something new
Alan owns a chain of Steamer Heavens
And Barry is the software king
And somebody told me in the early 80's
You were gonna be the Next Big Thing
Well now that was just a rumor
But I guess I'm doin' fine
Three weeks out of the rehab
Living one day at a time
Sneaking up on the new century
What a shame about me
What a shame about me
I'm thinking of a major Jane Street sunrise
And the goddess on the fire escape was you
We both ran out of small talk
The connection seemed to go dead
I was about to say, hey, have a nice life
When she touched my hand and said:
You know I just had this great idea
This could be very cool
Why don't we grab a cab to my hotel
And make believe we're back at our old school
I said babe you look delicious
And you're standing very close
But like, this is Lower Broadway
And you're talking to a ghost
Take a good look it's easy to see
What a shame about me
What a shame about me
Songwriters:  Donald Fagan and Walter BeckerOn the water down in New Orleans
My baby's the pearl of the quarter
She's a charmer like you never seen
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
Where the sailor spends his hard-earned pay
Red beans and rice for a quarter
You can see her almost any day
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I said hello
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
I walked alone down the miracle mile
I met my baby by the shrine of the martyr
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
She loved the million dollar words I say
She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her
She said she loved me and was on her way
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous
And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I love her so
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I love her so
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to goIt must have been my lucky Thursday
Your dad went on that spree
Before the crew could put out the fires
You hopped a bus for NYC
Down in Tampa the future looked desperate and dark
Now you're the wonderwaif of Gramercy Park
Who makes the morning fabulous?
Who says today's a fun day?
Why do I feel like sailing again?
Honey it's you, Janie Runaway
Let's grab some takeout from Dean and Deluca
A hearty gulping wine
You be the showgirl, I'll be Sinatra
Way back in '59
Sweetness in heels, look at you in long black gloves
Come to Old Blue Eyes tell me, who do you love
Who makes the traffic interesting?
Rescues a dreary Sunday
Who makes me feel like painting again?
Honey it's you, Janie Runaway
Let's plan a weekend alone together
Out to Binky's place
The sugar shack in Pennsylvania
Or would that be a federal case?
We'll take the Big Red, the Blazer, it's nice inside
And guess who's coming along for the ride
Who has a friend named Melanie
Who's not afraid to try new things?
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain?
Possibly you, Janie Runaway
Who makes the morning fabulous?
Rescues a dreary Sunday
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain?
Possibly you, Janie RunawayLet me put it this way, doll
I know it's getting late
I can tell from the planes of your face
That you're from out of state
But here in the Willows, now, here's the deal
Tomorrow's for squares, and tonight's for real
Drop me off in groove time
Do you hear the slang of ages?
Show me how it's done
Now, did you say you were from the Netherlands
Or was that "nether world"?
If you grew up in Amsterdam
Well, then I'm the Duke of Earl
These tabs look iffy, but you say they're good
Let's roll with the homeys and knock on wood
Drop me off in groove time
Soothe me with the slang of ages
Show me where I turn
You are part of the dreaming
The end of my life so far
Or something halfway in between
You ought to know
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Damn, she skipped dimensions
Was it something that I said?
Or something I was thinking
When she opened up my head?
Let me make it right, babe, never mind how
There's a crazy little place I know called "Be There Now"
Drop me off in groove time
Do you hear the slang of ages?
Show me how it's done
Drop me off in groove time
Soothe me with the slang of ages
This is where I turn
That's right
Slang meIf you listen, you can hear it
It's the laughter in the street
It's the motion in the music
And the fire beneath your feet
All the signs are right this time
You don't have to try so very hard
If you live in this world
You're feelin' the change of the guard
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
All you cowboys and your neighbors
Can you swallow up your pride?
Take your guns off, if you're willin'
And you know we're on your side
If you wanna get thru' the years
It's high time you played your card
If you live in this world
You're feelin' the change of the guard
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
If you wanna get thru' the years
It's high time you played your card
If you live in this world
You're feelin' the change of the guard

New York City no more
He don't celebrate Sunday
On a Saturday night no more
Daddy don't need no lock and key
For the piece he stowed
Out on Avenue D
Daddy don't live in that
New York City no more
Daddy don't drive in that
El Dorado no more
He don't travel on down
To the neighborhood liquor store
Lucy still loves her coke and rum
But she sits alone
Cause her daddy can't come
Daddy don't drive in that
El Dorado no more
No more
Driving like a fool out to Hackensack
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack
He says I gotta see a joker
And I'll be right back
No my daddy don't live in that
New York City no more, no more
He can't get tight every night
Pass out on the barroom floor
No, daddy can't get no fine cigar
But we know you're smoking
Wherever you are
Daddy don't live in that
New York City no more
No more
No, no, no, no, noOur man Abu squeezes off 20 tracer rounds
And that's when she jumps the turnstile
And as she clings to the roof of the speeding train
The Double A down to Sheridan Square
Her cell phone rings
It's, like, her stupid father
Be in the door by ten—again
Pixeleen
Dream deep my three times perfect ultrateen
Pixeleen
Born in the bogs of Jersey
Trained how to love and spy hard
Dropped on the streets of Roppongi
Soaked through on the floor of a noodle shop
And when Abu rams the clip in the mini-Glock
Up on the catwalk inside the warehouse
You whip a knife from the top of your go-go boot
Just a flash of spectacular thigh
Your pager starts to throb
It's your as-if boyfriend Randall
Better keep it real—or whatever
Pixeleen
Rave on my sleek and soulful cyberqueen
Pixeleen
Penned by a hack in the Palisades
Backed by some guys from Columbia
Shot all in digital video
For a million and change
Flash back to cool summer nights
Freddy can we cut to the chase?
In a room above your garage
Everything about me is different
Symmetrical and clean
This is what I see
Just a girl in girlie trouble
Dancing in the video
With gun and tambourine
Pixeleen
Be good my three times perfect ultrateen

Born on the floor of a noodle shop
Dropped in the bogs of Jersey
Shot by a guy from Columbia
Soaked through all in digital video
Girl with the sweet backstory
Pitched in a trailer in Burbank
Cast by a cool-enough yes man
Screened at a festival in UtahRose darling come to me
Snake Mary's gone to bed
All our steaming sounds of love
Cannot disturb her in her night
Or raise her sleeping head
All I ask of you
Is make my wildest dreams come true
No one sees and no one knows
Rose darling come to me
Snake Mary dreams along
I would guess she's in Detroit
With lots of money in the bank
Although I could be wrong
You must know it's right
The spore is on the wind tonight
You won't feel it till it grows
Rose darling  my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours down
Rose darling come to me
The clock is close at hand
All my empty words of love
Can never screen the flash I feel
Or make you understand
Oh honey, can't you see
I know it's real it's got to be
Why not chase it where it goes
Rose darling  my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours down
Rose darling  my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours downIt's high time for a walk on the real side
Let's admit the bastards beat us
I move to dissolve the corporation
In a pool of margaritas
So let's switch off all the lights
Light up all the Luckies
Crankin' up the afterglow
Cause we're goin' out of business
Everything must go
Talk about your major pain and suffering
Now our self-esteem is shattered
Show the world a mighty hidey-ho face
As we go sliding down the ladder
It was sweet up at the top
'Til that ill wind started blowing
Now it's cozy down below
Cause we're goin' out of business
Everything must go
We gave it our best shot
But keep in mind we got a lot
The sky, the moon, good food and the weather
First-run movies—does anybody get lucky twice?
Wouldn't it be nice…
Tell me can you dig it Miss Fugazy
Now it's gone from late to later
Frankly I could use a little face time
In the service elevator
And if Dave from Acquisitions
Wants to get in on the action
With his Handicam in tow
Well we're goin' out of business
Everything must go
Can it be the sorry sun is rising
Guess it's time for us to book it
Talk about the famous road not taken
In the end we never took it
And if somewhere on the way
We got a few good licks in
No one's ever gonna know
Cause we're goin' out of business
Everything must goIf I had my way
I would move to another lifetime
I'd quit my job
Ride the train through
The misty nighttime
I'd be ready when my feet touch ground
Wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me
Then they'll have me
Any world that I'm welcome to 
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I can hear your words
When you speak of what
You are and have seen
I can see your hand
Reaching out through
A shining daydream
Where the days and nights
Are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame
Honey, I will be there
Yes, I'll be there
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I got this thing inside me
That's got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I can't explain away
I think I'll go to the park
Watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head
What my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey, I will be there
Yes, I'll be there
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Any world that I'm welcome to

Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome toLost in the barrio, I walk like an injun
So Carlo won't suspect
That something's wrong here
I dance in place and paint my face
And act like I belong here
Throw back the little ones
And pan fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them
Hot licks and rhetoric
Don't count much for nothing
Be glad if you can use what you borrow
So I pawn my crown for a ride uptown
And buy it back tomorrow
Throw back the little ones
And pan fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze them
Done like a matador, I pray for the weekend
And hope the little girls still throw roses
Else I'll change my bait and move upstate
Before the season closes
Throw back the little ones
And pan fry the big ones
Use tact, poise and reason
And gently squeeze themBrother in tears
Look at this chain of sorrows
Stretching all the way from here and now to hell and gone
I was Kid Clean
She was Anne de Siècle
Just a thrill away from punching through to the cosmic wow
It started out good
Then it got lots better
Makin' up the rules as we went along
But with a business like this
There's a gnarly downside
I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
Swingin' so hard
We burned right through the summer
Till the axis of pain/pleasure sheared the arc of desire
From the Rebus affair
To the streets of Culver City
Places and events slip below the horizon line
Now at this time
Into our pretty story
The truth compels us to bring a certain name
Meet if you will
Dr. Warren Kruger
I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
She reached out for my hand
While I watched myself lurch across the room
And I almost got there
I almost got there
I almost got there
Almost got there
Look in my eyes
Don't you see the core is frozen?
You can't ask me to access the dreams I don't have now
Sadly for us
Our little talk is over
So together we'll endure the tyranny of the disallowed
Don't you love Port Blanc
When Hooterie is over?
When the girls get easy and the crowds are gone
A weekend of bliss
Then the rainy season
I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood
I'm way deep into nothing specialI could be wrong but I have seen your face before
You were the man that I saw running from his door
You owed him money but you gave him something more
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?
You were the founders of the clinic in the hill
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?
When you're born to play the fool
And you've seen all the western movies
Woe to the one who does you wrong
You'll hide in the bushes
Murder the man
With Luger in hand
I understand that you will soon be leavin' town
Don't try to call me when they finally run you down
Just give fair warning any time you come around
With a gun
With a gun
You will be what you are just the same
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand
And leave him lying in the rain?My coat is black and the moon is yellow
Here is where I get off
As you can see for yourself old girl in the Green Book
I tango down to the smoky lobby
My eyes adjust to the light
The new cashier looks like Jill St. John
Can that be right?
I'm rolling into the bar at Joey's
They're getting ready to close
Here she comes very "Kiss Me Deadly'?
My life, my love, my third hand rose
Flash ahead to a yummy playback
Just you and me in a room
Double dreaming a page at a time in the Green Book
The torso rocks and the eyes are keepers
Now where'd we sample those legs?
I'm thinking Marilyn 4.0 in the Green Book
I like the neon I love the music
Anachronistic but nice
The seamless segue from fun to fever
It's a sweet device
I'm so in love with this dirty city
This crazy grid of desire
The festive icons along the way
The boardwalk, the lovers, the house on fire
She's kind of cute but a little younger
She's got the mood and the moves
It's kinda scary to dig yourself in the Green BookAttention all shoppers
It's Cancellation Day
Yes the Big Adios
Is just a few hours away
It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
You'll need the tools for survival
And the medicine for the blues
The sweet treats and surprises
For the little buckaroos
It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mall
We've got a sweetheart Sunset Special
And all of the standard stuff
'Cause in the morning—that gospel morning
You'll have to do for yourself when the going gets tough
Roll your cart back up the aisle
Kiss the checkout girls goodbye
Ride the ramp to the freeway
Beneath the blood orange sky
It's last call
To do your shopping
At the last mallShe's lost - she's late
She's zooming on a couch somewhere
Or high - or home
I'm not supposed to call her there
I wait - I smoke
I stare into my coke
It's happening again
I tell myself that it's over and done, amen
Her skin - like milk
It's like she's never seen the sun
Some hearts to crunch
Is more like her idea of fun
I know - she's ill
I'm cruising for a spill
I'm hanging just the same
I need to be in the heat
Of her cold white flame
Another negative girl
At the edge of the frame
Deliciously toxic
The original classic thing - more of the same
She's in the zone
Crying on the phone
I need you here
I'm on the street again
Staggering out into the burn of the brain dead dawn
To arrive in time to find her gone
She's on the train
To somewhere up by Fordham Road
Her reptile brain
Locked down and ready in combat mode
Some cash - a key
This guy she has to see
A doctor friend uptown
And maybe she gets to me when she comes back down
Another negative girl
Spinning out of the frame
Exquisitely limpid
The original classic thing - more of the same
A goof - a buzz
If that is what it was
Then how do you explain
The way she looks when she's
Dragging me out to dance with her
In the summer rain
Another negative girl
At the edge of the frame
Exhausting and luscious
The original classic thing - more of the sameWhere did the bastard run?
Is he still around?
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby
I'm gonna get a gun
Shoot the lover down
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby?
Traces are everywhere
In our happy home
Now you better tell me everything you did baby
I jumped out of my easy chair
It was not my own
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby
I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later
Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening
You know how people talk
I wonder what they say
I think you better tell me everything you did baby
I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later
You never came to me
When you were so inclined
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby
I know where baby's at
I know your filthy mind
Now you're gonna do me everything you did baby
You did babyI was scrapin' bottom
Groping in the dark
It takes a crusty punk to really beat
The mean streets of Medicine Park
So I shifted left and out of town
Then I clicked my heels and I doubled down to
Blues Beach, I'm frying
Sizzling in the merciful rays
And it's the long sad Sunday of the early resigned
I went to Central Station
To catch that early bus
They were gassed and runnin' in every which way
But unhappily not for us
Here come Trina—the child bride
I said hey pretty girl—can I cop a ride to
Blues beach, it's raining
I'm chilling at the Manatee Bar
Well it's a stone soul picnic for the early resigned
We can rent a paranymphic glider
My hypothetical friend
And we could sail away to the bending end
Grab Big Dog a blanket
Angel of my heart
Things may get a whole lot worse
Before suddenly falling apart
Give your roommate Yvonne a ring
'Cause if she still wants in I gotta pull some strings
On Blues Beach, I'm dying
Freezin' in the merciful rays
And it's the long sad Sunday of the early resignedThat must be her again
She's leaning on my bell
That cold psychotic brain
The one I know so well
So I'm nailed to the floor in the no-option zone
There's about zero chance she'll give up and go home
This endless afternoon
It started on the day I met her
Lunch with Gina is forever
She's coming round the corner
Her body's just a blur
I peel out like The Flash
It don't mean boo to her
So I duck into Nino's—she's barred from the place
The minute I walk out she's right in my face
She's got nothing but time
No use in trying to be clever
Lunch with Gina is forever
Now I'm in my apartment
The blinds down the lights out
The phone rings God help me
There's nobody home
I crouch on the carpet
Not breathing just being
Like meat on the bone
I'm in a cozy booth
Maybe my watch is fast
Another Tanqueray
I'll wait till twenty past
I'm about to go postal when she waltzes in
I guess she's a knockout—hey where have I been?
The waiter never comes
God knows the service could be better
Lunch with Gina is forever
Coffee and a kiss
Maybe later maybe never
Lunch with Gina…Cold, daring
No flies on me
Sorry, angel
I must take what I see
Green earrings
I remember
The rings of rare design
I remember
The look in your eyes
I don't mind
Greek medallion
Sparkles when you smile
Sorry, angel
I get hungry like a child

I don't mindSir, I parked my juggernaut at your gate
Fifteen-thousand miles and I'm feeling great
I've been on the run, but I done my time
You just can't stand still with a friend like mine
There's a bear that walks like a man
Better shake him fast
Better hide yourself if you can
Cause he wants your ass
I believe you'll do quite well
But only time will tell
If you got the bear or the bear got you
Drive the coach and six for the county line
Point me towards the tube and I'll be just fine
Mr. Quick has flown from the cosmic zoo
Someone must be him and I just found you
There's a bear that walks like a man
Better shake him fast
Better hide yourself if you can
Cause he wants your ass
I believe you'll do quite well
But only time will tell
If you got the bear or the bear got youI was born and raised and lived and loved and died today
But when I saw the lights my word was hip hooray
It took me by surprise
It was right before my eyes
Talkin' bout my home
The city in the sky
Talkin' bout my home
The only home I ever known
Well you're halfway through the gate where you will live inside
Well I knew a dude who said it ain't no trip he lied
Well I saw his face, oh God
When we crossed the promenade
Well now I've got to catch that wonderful express
So I'll just say good evening to you all God bless
Just put me on that train
That great celestial planeCharlie Freak had but one thing to call his own
Three weighed ounce pure golden ring, no precious stone
Five nights without a bite, no place to lay his head
And if nobody takes him in he'll soon be dead
On the street he spied my face, I heard him hail
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale
Poor man, he showed his hand, so righteous was his need
And me so wise I bought his prize for chicken feed
Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind
Poor kid, he overdid, embraced the spreading haze
And while he sighed his body died in fifteen ways
When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay
'Round his arm the plastic tag read 'D.O.A'
Yes Jack, I gave it back, the ring I could not own
Now come, my friend, I'll take your hand and lead you homeSavoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation
It's Parker's band with a smooth style of syncopation
Kansas city born and growing, you won't believe what the boys are blowing
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band
You'll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo
You'll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo
Suddenly the music hits you, it's a bird in flight that just can't quit you
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band
We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance
Me and you will listen to a little bit of what made the preacher dance
Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection
And if you can't fly you'll have to move in with the rhythm section
Either way you're bound to function, 52nd Street's the junction
You got to come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parker's
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's bandI got one and you want four
It's so hard to help you
I can't keep up with you no more
And you treat me like it's a sin
But you can't lock me in
You want me here with you right to the end
No thank you my friend
I fear the monkey in your soul
Won't you turn that bebop down?
I can't hear my heart beat
Where's that fatback chord I found?
But honey don't you think it was wrong
To interrupt my song?
I'll pack my things and run so far from here
Goodbye dear
I fear the monkey in your soul
Don't you think it was wrong
To interrupt my song?
I'll pack my things and run so far from here
Goodbye dear
I fear the monkey in your soul
I fear the monkey in your soulHe takes all my money
You know I'm through with Buzz
Yes I'm through with Buzz
All right, oh yeah, uh huh
He's not very funny
You know I'm through with Buzz
Yes I'm through with Buzz
All right, oh yeah, uh huh
I remember when he stole my girl
Drug her all around the world
You know I'm cool, yes I feel alright
Except when I'm in my room and it's late at night
Maybe he's a fairy
You know I'm through with Buzz
Yes I'm through with Buzz
All right, oh yeah, uh huh, all rightI lived in no holy house but the Grand Hotel
The back streets of this old town I know so well
And I drunk of no holy wine save muscatel;
Now my friend, I've got to go
You tell everyone I know
I'm sayin' goodbye, bye, bye, Dallas;
I can't stay
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday
Bye, bye, Dallas; got to go
And I remember when they told me so
Right now I'm wonderin' where
The good times have gone;
All the things I never loved when they was mine
Hot city and an empty pocket make a man think on;
I've been living low so long
Gotta get back where I belong
Bye, bye, Dallas;
I can't stay
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday
Hey no farther; it's understood
Livin' undercover don't do no good
Bye, bye, DallasLeft New Hyde Park to hold my own in New York town
Groped in the dark until I faced the place where scallywags are found
Sharks and yo-yos everywhere
Baby, you can take it from there
Now there's a horse in town
Eyes of green, haunches chestnut brown
Yes, there's a horse in town
So saddle up and ride, ride, ride
Can you reveal the day he came, the day he'll go
This way I feel the time is moving much too slow
When he passes by your tent
You’ll be glad when night is spent
Now there's a horse in town
Eyes of green, haunches chestnut brown
Yes, there's a horse in town
So saddle up and ride, ride, ride, ride
The shoes of my friend
They stomp his name into the ground
Let's not pretend
We know with all that fearsome sound
Following my frozen trail
Moving to the inside rail
Now there's a horse in town
Eyes of green, haunches chestnut brown
Yes, there's a horse in town
So saddle up and ride, ride, ride, ride
Saddle up and ride 
Saddle up and ride 
Saddle up and ride 
Saddle up and ride My old man
He been around the world
And he tells me everything
He told me how to tie a sailor's knot
And made me how to swim
And though my man and I got it together
He still knows what to do
He say come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
Come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
You can tell me you're a man of means
And I wouldn't believe it's true
Today I seen you selling door to door
And I know it makes you blue
Well you're bettin' your dollar on the wind and rain
When you put your money down
I say come on and sail the waterway
And turn your head around
Come on and sail the waterway
And turn your head around
You know the tide is high
And the westward wind won't quit ya
And you know what you got to do
Cause the time is right
And the tide will wait for you
Well if you're tired of the race and the runners
And the things they make you do
I say come on and sail the waterway
Come on and sail the waterway
Come on and sail the waterway
It feels so good on you
You know the tide is high
And the westward wind won't quit ya
Well you know what you got to do
Cause the time is right
And the tide will wait for you
Come on and sail the waterway with me...I heard them whispering
I saw their eyes, their jests
Their secret smiles
Dance a wild new tango
Overrun the great placenta
And who received the first bang-bang?
It was the whole goddamned gang
What can the price for freedom be?
The old regime is falling
The ball and chain is gone, you see
The winning team is calling
For volunteers, don't hesitate
The old regime is falling
Who got the bottles?
Who got the ladies' fashions
And the tray?
Did you get the radio?
Did you get the princess' collar?
Well don't you know I got the cheap
So what you got you'd better keep
But that brunette, she comes with me
The old regime is falling
The ball and chain is gone, you see
The winning team is calling
For volunteers, don't hesitate
The old regime is falling
Gotta get a move on
What's in your hand?
It's just my things left in the sand
Now I'll drive with four wheel drive
Air in the breadbox
Cheese in the mouths of babes
Is fine with me
Yes I'm on your side
Deal me in and do your preaching
But won't you carve the turkey now?
I know I've earned my share somehow
By morning who knows where I'll be?
The old regime is falling
The ball and chain is gone, you see
The winning team is calling
For volunteers, don't hesitate
The old regime is fallingDown at the Lido they welcome you
With sausage and beer
Klaus and The Rooster have been there too
But lately he spends his time here
Hangin' with the Mayor and all his friends
And nobody cares
Where the sailor shuts out the sunrise
Blacked out on the stairs
CHORUS:
Knock twice, rap with your cane
Feels nice, you're out of the rain
We got your skinny girl
Here at the Western World
Ruthie will give you the silver key
To open the red door
Lay down your Jackson and you will see
The sweetness you've been cryin' for
In the night you hide from the madman
You're longing to be
But it all comes out on the inside
Eventually
CHORUS
In the night you hide from the madman
You're longing to be
But it all comes out on the inside
Eventually
CHORUS Rock 'n' roll
They're throwin' a party for big Ida Lee
The man from the skyway, the Chinaman and me
There's so much affection it's making me crazy
I've run out of reasons for keepin' it neat
Everybody's laughin'
Everybody's makin' love
Ida Lee, it's you I'm thinkin' of
Threw out the favors, the hooters and the hats
We put out the candle, oh, and then blew out the cat
Oh, my temperature's rising, we're all on the chaise lounge
Big Ida Lee, she's nowhere to be found
Everybody's laughin'
Everybody's makin' love
Ida Lee, it's you I'm thinkin' of
Everybody's laughin'
Everybody's makin' love
Ida Lee, it's you I'm thinkin' of
They open the air shaft as Ida walks in
She comes up to me and whispers, "Honey, where have you been?"
I'm stripping my gears, I'm blowing my fuse
Cause Ida Lee's giving me somewhat more than I can use
"Solo"
"Fade"I don't like waiting for a knock on the door
I don't like wondering why
I got no mercy for a man and his tears
He's just living a lie
I got a feeling like I'm losing my cool
That's no way to be
You got me crying, got me playing the fool
That's what you're doing to me
Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I don't want to live alone again
My old man never told me how
I don't like lying all alone in my bed
Nobody calling my name
I can't say thank you for a kick in the head
But I need you just the same
See me settin’ by the side of the road
People starin’ and smilin’
They got no mercy for a man and his tears
Can't you hear me cryin’?
Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I don't want to live alone again
My old man never told me how
You gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I don't want to live alone again
My old man never told me howPublishers: ©Royalty Network

Brain Tap Shuffle
Lose your mind
You'll see the oceans part
You'll think your goin' blind
You can talk about your daily grind
While she'll dish out the soft shoe
If makin' money doesn't suit your mind

Here for you
You can sit there and suck your thumb
Hear the rock and roll hum
But you're just a crazy wall flower

Brain Tap Shuffle
Lose your mind
You'll see the oceans part
You'll think your goin' blindI'm about to cry and I don't know the reason
I can see the start of a difficult season
I can't let it get me down when everything is going wrong
Ain't it good to know that I can be strong?
Darling as long as you go where I go
I can't complain about the pain and the heartache*
The tears when your kisses disguise the lies
My eyes don't see
And what do I need to know
As long as you go where I go?
Wake up in the morning where the bad news can't find me
Walking in the sunshine with you right behind me
This lazy living sure treats me right, but come tomorrow we'll be gone
And anywhere at all is where I belong
Darling as long as you go where I go
I'm unaware of the cares and the sorrow
The hurt that your loving can hide from me
My eyes don't see
And what do I need to know
As long as you go where I go?Hunting in the Sea of Japan
Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him
So bold with his gun in his hand
Of his furs there was no need to remind him
Tripping over a Holy Man
Mind that here you don't choose your friends
Ambrose asked for a helping hand
He heaved his chest, and pointed West
To where the river runs
With Josie back home on his mind
Brushing off the fruit flies of the season
And 'Brosie was surely struck blind
By a sight that defies human reason:
On an island of gleaming rock
Jutting up from the blue lagoon
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode
That made our hero swoon
A finer minor from China
The World when the traveler returned
As you know played out its bloody romances
But Ambrose he knew what he'd learned
With his prize in hand he took his chances
Soon the sound that delights the ear
Blended in with the armies' roar
When the warriors strained to hear
This new bebop, this shooting star
Their guns were bullet-full
A finer minor from China
A finer minor from China
A finer minor from ChinaIf I had my way I would move to another lifetime
I'd quit my job ride the train through the misty night time
I'll be ready when my feet touch ground wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me then they'll have me
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I can hear your words when you speak of what you are and have seen
I can see your hand reaching out through a shining daydream
Where the days and nights are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame, honey I will be there, yes I'll be there
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
I got this thing inside me
That's got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I can't explain away
I think I'll go to the park watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head what my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey, I will be there, yes I'll be there
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
...The fish are flying in the county seat
The cops are searching for a missing beat
And Billy Burroughs, is he still on the nod?
Deal with the girlfriend, not a demigod
But be assured that if this shaken world is sucked into the sun
More to come
There’s more to come
And when the seventh day at last is done
More to come
There’s more to come
The ladies sure look like they're craving for me
But ain't that just what they're supposed to be?
I hear the man is moving in next door
The boys will have to use the second floor
You might have answers I can understand, but I know only one
More to come
Yeah, more to come
And when the seventh day at last is done
More to come
Yeah, more to come
The kids have torn a yellow packard apart
Ain't that enough to break a rich man’s heart?
I see the rats have found the cradle again
I'll let you know if I remember when
There's one conclusion that I must defend, it's where we started from
Ho! More to come
Yeah, more to come
And when the seventh day at last is done
Ohhh, more to come
More to comeDaytime you're too proud to brag about the badge you wore
Nighttime you're too tired to drag your chains across the floor
All your guns are gone I'm told or in the aerodrome
Did you die the day they sold the ones you left at home?
Hold my hand in the Android Warehouse
Who's to know if you take a dive?
Ain't life grand in the Android Warehouse?
What a burner when you take off your goggles and find
That you're alive
That you're alive
Did you really gobble up the things they claim you ate?
Were you fit to swallow it or scared to clean your plate?
Have you tried to calculate the hours they'd applaud?
I would guess it's somewhat less for just another fraud
Hold my hand in the Android Warehouse
Who's to know if you take a dive?
Ain't life grand in the Android Warehouse?
What a burner when you take off your goggles and find
That you're alive
That you're alive
That you're alive...Ten cent store is in my way
Just can't do what the captain say
There's not enough night
And too much day
Ain't got time to hear
That stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
Wish I was a hired gun
Cruel shogun, a poor man's son
One day I'd stop and click my heels
Turn around to see
My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top down
The troubador is in disguise
That's incurious, I used my eyes
My own two hands were on the keys
This is no mystery
My stone piano playing for me
A song without words or harmony
A stone piano calvary bound
Rolling along with the top downWhen I'm sure you’re gone at last
I make believe that I have no past
I make good cheer and wipe away all the tears
I take another room, find another friend
And when I feel that you're not real I stop and then
Oh wow it's you again
How odd I should meet you here
Oh wow it's you again
You haunt me
You taunt me
Why don't you disappear?
This hotel had a view
One brick wall and shades of blue
I paid my bill and started over again
I flipped another penny, counted up to ten
I let’er rip just like a gypsy dog and then
Oh wow it's you again
How odd I should meet you here
Oh wow it's you again
You haunt me
You taunt me
Why don't you disappear?
In this warm and foreign place
There's not one familiar face
It seems this time I've left myself far behind
I write another letter I know I'll never send
I lock the door and walk out for some air and then
Oh wow it's you again
How odd I should meet you here
Oh wow it's you again
You haunt me
You taunt me
Why don't you disappear?Bodhisattva
Would you take me by the hand

Would you take me by the hand
Can you show me

The sparkle of your china
Can you show me
